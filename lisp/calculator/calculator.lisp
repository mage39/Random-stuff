;;; "define the function `combine-expr` to take an arithmetic operator,
;;; an operand, and a list expression, and return the expr with the operator
;;; and operand applied to the first member of the list. for example,
;;; `(combine-expr '3 '+ '(5 - 6 * 8))` should evaluate to `((3 + 5) - 6 * 8)`"

;;; this is less confusing now that i took the time to type it out, but i
